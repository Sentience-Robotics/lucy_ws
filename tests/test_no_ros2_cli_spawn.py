"""Guard against spawning ROS nodes through the `ros2` CLI.

`ros2 run` and `ros2 launch` start the real node as a child of themselves, and
on Windows a console-script shim adds another layer. Signalling the handle you
hold then leaves the node running, and capturing its output blocks past the
timeout because the surviving child still holds the pipe. Resolve the
executable and run it directly instead (`node_argv`), or ask the graph with
rclpy rather than `ros2 topic`.
