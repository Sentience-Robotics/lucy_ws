#
# min_active 0 asks only whether /controller_manager answered at all.
#
# Used by config/launcher_config.json so core reads ready only when the robot can
# actually be driven. Process liveness is not enough: controller_manager happily
# runs with every controller stuck `unconfigured`/`inactive` — which is exactly
# what a stale /robot_description or a held spawner lock produces — and the TUI
# would otherwise show a green [RUNNING] next to a robot that cannot move.
#
# Two costs to contain:
#   * `ros2 control list_controllers` needs a full Pixi activation, far too slow
#     for the launcher's 1s poll, so the answer is cached briefly.
#   * it blocks waiting for /controller_manager when the manager is down, so the
#     call is bounded (macOS ships no coreutils `timeout`).
